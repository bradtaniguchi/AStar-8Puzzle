Notes on AStar Search
gScore = the base score of the node, simply the incremental cost of moving from the start node to this node
	to get this add variable to EightPuzzleState
fScore = is the Heuristic cost, or estimating the distance between each node and the goal
	
Other things to remember:
	Best-First search, or looking into the best opportunity FIRST
	Hamming priority function, the number of blocks in the wrong position, plus number of moves 
	made so far to get to the search node
